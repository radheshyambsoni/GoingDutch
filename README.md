# GoingDutch
- A split bill application which can split bills and tasks easily while going out with family and friends.

- This project describes and presents a system designed and built with the intention of reducing issues regarding bill splitting by taking advantage of the technology and recent legislature which allows the service to eliminate deficiencies associated with financial transactions settled via paper-based means.

- 'Going Dutch' is a split-bill payment app which is flexible enough to calculate traditional single-source funded payments as well as multi-source funded ones. 
Which means both associating several funding sources with an account belonging to the same system user as well as allowing multiple account holders to fund the same purchase.

- The particular focus of the system is the centralization of all occasional and recurring bills that is transactions where several parties are beneficiaries of a product or a service, or where the consumer given a grace period to settle his or her bills.

- The analysis and design specification address the deficiencies in the settlement options by creating an architectural design as a software package which will provide the following gains: significant increase in automation within the splitting system, decrease overheads through elimination of labor intensive tasks such as check processing, and more over contribute to a higher usage among the consumers by satisfying a yet to be addressed consumer need.
